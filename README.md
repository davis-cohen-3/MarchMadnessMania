March Madness Mania (kaggle competition) on only men's tournaments

Participated in the March Madness Machine Learning Competition (2023) provided by Kaggle. Here is the link to the competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2023/overview .

There are several notebooks that I have to show my work (one of which is still in the process of finalizing). 

The first notebook (ML WORK) is where I did all my data aggregating and pandas work to create my final dataset that has all of the tournament games with each team's individual features side by side. Instead of using the same feature twice (i.e. points per game for team A and team B, I did teamAPPG-teamBPPG). There's a bunch more logic I did here to make sure that it would be compatible for modelling. I also did a lot of feature engineering in this notebook. 

The second notebook I worked on is the EDA notebook where I made a bunch of plots and looked for and stories in the data. Finally made some heatmaps to see which features correlate with the target variable. 

Lastly the third notebook is called modelling. Where I am working on the pipeline for modelling the data and getting the best predictions possible without overfitting.
